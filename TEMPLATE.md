## Introduction

This tutorial guides you through building a custom anti-theft security system for electric scooters. With the alarming rate of increasing micro-mobility device theft such as electric scooters and bicycles on campus, it is very important to secure your electric scooter. Both of our team members have experienced their electric scooters being stolen in the past, and we know how important the issue is, so we want to help any UCSD student who is concerned by this issue. Our solution provides an affordable and effective way to secure your electric scooter using readily available components. We hope this tutorial can help you secure your electric scooter, gaining some practical embedded development skills, and save you from the headache of dealing with stolen scooters.

### Learning Objectives

- Understanding basic electronics and microcontroller programming
- Understanding basic PCB design
- Building a motion detection system with BNO sensors
- Developing practical problem solving skills

### Background Information

Micro-mobility devices, including bikes and electric scooters, are easily stolen on the UCSD campus. 
According to the 2024 Annual Security & Fire Safety Report from the UCSD Police Department, theft of micro-mobility devices such as electric scooters and bicycles has increased at an alarming rate. Causing thousands of dollar lost and extremely inconvenience for students and faculties.

## Getting Started

For any software prerequisites, write a simple excerpt on each
technology the participant will be expecting to download and install.
Aim to demystify the technologies being used and explain any design
decisions that were taken. Walk through the installation processes
in detail. Be aware of any operating system differences.
For hardware prerequisites, list all the necessary components that
the participant will receive. A table showing component names and
quantities should suffice. Link any reference sheets or guides that
the participant may need.
The following are stylistic examples of possible prerequisites,
customize these for each workshop.

### Required Downloads and Installations

List any required downloads and installations here.
Make sure to include tutorials on how to install them.
You can either make your own tutorials or include a link to them.

### Required Components

This is all the electrical components needed for the project.

| Component Name | Quantity |
|----------------|-----------|
| ESP32-S3 Dev Board | 1 |
| ESP32-C6-MINI-1-N4 | 1 |
